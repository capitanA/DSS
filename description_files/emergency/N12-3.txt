1. Alter to starboard to begin a J-approach. In open water, use a safe speed. Reach the ice edge about 1.5 knots (never hit the ice edge at any significant speed). Once you’re in the ice then you can speed up.2. Set your speed, heading, and the momentum of the vessel all correct when you are entering the ice edge.3. Move up the side of the FPSO.
4. Plan your distance off from the FPSO. This depends on floe size. The average floe size is about the width of the support vessel.  So pass along the FPSO at about a ship’s width off the hull.5. Change the vessel heading to stem the current (at a northern heading) above the FPSO.6. Perform lateral motion from side to side to push the ice aside. The distance for moving back and forth from the FPSO’s bow would be relative to the size of the support vessel. (from the FPSO bow to the dashed line in the diagram which is a line drawn up from the bottom corner of the zone).
