1. As you enter the ice, change your heading until you was perpendicular with the FPSO bow (e.g. approach the hull of the FPSO towards the bow)2. Initiate your turn to port when you get to a line extending from the west side of the clear away zone (the dashed line from top port corner of zone), and give yourself enough distance from the FPSO. Use thruster to turn to port, that will help the ice floe moves down the hull.3. Position the support vessel so that it’s pointing away from the FPSO (stern facing).4. Then when you get into position, hold and maintain position using rudders. Start with port rudder toward out to port and again use the starboard engine and rudder to maintain position in line. Stay close proximity to the centerline of the FPSO to keep that floe off.
