1. Approach is good, proceed closer to FPSO to remove all ice prior to rotating
2. Use pushing method closer to FPSO so that side is clear of ice. Ask for distances from Mate
3. Position vessel upstream from lifeboat zone. Use thrusters to maintain position perpendicular to FPSO heading
4. Use leeway and current to block ice from zone
