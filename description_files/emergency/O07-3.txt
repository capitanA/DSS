1. Continue following a similar approach to diagram, approaching directly upstream of lifeboat zone
2. Position heading so that vessel is approximately perpendicular to FPSO. Consider positioning stern-to for improved visibility
3. Maintain position using thrusters
4. Use current and leeway to block ice from lifeboat zone
