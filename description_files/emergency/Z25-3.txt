1. Proceed bow into the ice. Make an initial turn to stem current with the vesselâ€™s thrusters at approx. 500-600 meters or 300-400 meters above the FPSO. If you enter directly to the zone, and then push up against the current and ice floes, you use lots of thrust and it is not recommended.
2. When behind the vessel is clear, turn the vessel and let the vessel to slide down from position 2 to 3. So the vessel creates ice-free zone on the port side of the FPSO.
3. Maintain the leeway position at position 3 in the diagram. Use prop-wash to move the ice around the FPSO on the starboard side. Make the distance between your stern and the FPSO as small as possible (about 5-10 meters).
4.In position 3, move back and forth (e.g. adjust between the two headings represented as 3) to keep the area to the port of the FPSO clear. Move to perpendicular position at 3 and hold it, then If ice building up, alter the heading a little bit so that the vessel shed some of that ice.
