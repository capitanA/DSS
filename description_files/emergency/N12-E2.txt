1. Alter to starboard to begin a J-approach. In open water, use a safe speed. Reach the ice edge about 1.5 knots (never hit the ice edge at any significant speed). Once you’re in the ice then you can speed up.2. Set your speed, heading, and the momentum of the vessel all correct when you are entering the ice edge.3. Move up the side of the FPSO.
4. Plan your distance off from the FPSO. This depends on floe size. The average floe size is about the width of the support vessel.  So pass along the FPSO at about a ship’s width off the hull.5. Alter to starboard and maneuver to put the stern alongside and being perpendicular to the FPSO (e.g. set up leeway position, stern of support vessel pointed towards the FPSO).6. Maintain position perpendicular to the FPSO. The distance of stern to FPSO would be about the floe size because you should  prevent the floe size from running down between the stern and the FPSO itself.
