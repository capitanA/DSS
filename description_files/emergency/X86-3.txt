1. Continue following a similar approach to diagram, approaching slightly UPSTREAM of lifeboat zone
2. Use pushing and prop-wash to clear ice from lifeboat zone while preparing to position perpendicular to FPSO heading
3. Maintain perpendicular heading and position using thrusters
4. Use current and leeway to block ice from lifeboat zone. You can apply pushing using thrusters and side of vessel as well.

Note: Diagram approach is generally good, but too far south! Position up-current from lifeboat zone
