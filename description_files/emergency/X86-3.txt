1. Continue following a similar approach, end slightly UPSTREAM of lifeboat zone
2. Use pushing and prop-wash to clear ice from lifeboat, then position perpendicular to FPSO heading
3. Maintain perpendicular heading and position using thrusters
4. Use current and leeway to block ice from lifeboat zone.
Note: Diagram approach is generally good, but too far south! Position up-current from lifeboat zone
