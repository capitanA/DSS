1. Continue following a similar J-approach to diagram, approaching slightly upstream of lifeboat zone
2. Use pushing and prop-wash to clear ice from lifeboat zone while preparing to position perpendicular to FPSO heading. Consider positioning stern-to the FPSO for increased visibility
3. Once upstream of lifeboat zone, maintain perpendicular heading and position using thrusters
4. Use current and leeway to block ice from lifeboat zone.
