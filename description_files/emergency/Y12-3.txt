1. Create a direct route to get close ahead of the FPSO (speed under 3 knots. If the FPSO was on fire choose 5 knots)2. Position the support vessel as a block (heading of 60 degrees, distance of 100 m above the FPSO, and bow far enough over towards the bowline/centerline of the FPSO not to  let the ice come between the vessels). let some ice flow and then give some prop-wash flushing at the same time.3. Move from DP2 (leeway) to DP3 (broadside pushing) once you see the ice is clearing the zone(position to the North, distance 100)4. Thrust to the west, try to clear out some zone then go back and forth to make a couple of thrust passes (The range of the broadside pushing depends on the situation but try to clear area closer to the FPSO in the zone).
