1. Start a J-approach in the water because it is free of ice and you would come down here quicker.2. Scoot up alongside the FPSO and use pushing and prop washing as the vessel moves through the zone and alongside the FPSO.3. Position the vessel up to the bow of the FPSO (at a 45 degree angle ahead of the FPSO), and use the prop wash to clear ice and other side of the zone. 4. Do a little fore and aft maneuvers to go ahead, flush some of the ice as it comes down, and then back up into position slowly. Repeat those maneuvers.
