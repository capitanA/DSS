1. Come further to south to approach the FPSO
2. Change the heading and turn stern to the FPSO and use the prop wash to create more of a lead and set your location close to the FPSO.
3. Use the leeway by starboard side to hold the ice up the zone.
Note to improve the approach:
1. heading is too far to the north, should be more to the southwest so the ice can flow out around the bow.
2. Use the leeway a little bit further forward of the clear away zone to execute the maneuver (not in the zone).
