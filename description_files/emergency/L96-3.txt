1. Continue following a similar approach to diagram, approaching directly upstream of lifeboat zone
2. Continue south, clearing ice from the zone, then return to upstream position, positioning vessel stern-towards FPSO on a similar angle as shown 
3. Maintain position using thrusters
4. Use current and leeway to block ice from lifeboat zone
