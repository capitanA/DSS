1. Continue following a similar approach to diagram, approaching slightly UPSTREAM of lifeboat zone
2. Use pushing and prop-wash to clear ice from lifeboat zone while preparing to position perpendicular to FPSO heading once upstream from midships area of FPSO
3. Maintain perpendicular heading and position using thrusters
4. Use current and leeway to block ice from lifeboat zone. You can apply pushing using thrusters and side of vessel as well.
