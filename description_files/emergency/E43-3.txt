1. Come further to south to approach the FPSO
2. Entering the ice edge
3. Change the heading perpendicular to the FPSO
4. Push the ice down the zone by starboard
5. Move up and use the leeway by port side to hold the ice up the zone
This in not actually an effective approach, note to improve the approach:
1. Set your heading before you get to the ice edge. it’s much easier to turn in open water than it is in the ice.
2. the bow of the vessel would need to be a little bit closer to the FPSO, just to prevent any of that ice flow from creeping between your vessel and the FPSO.
3. Don’t push the ice that is in the zone with the starboard, because the current will clear that ice. Focus on the ice above the zone.
