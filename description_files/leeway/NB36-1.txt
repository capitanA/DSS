1. Approach – come to the ice with 3 knots and once you get inside the zone start your turn to port.2. Proceed north of the zone, and stop at about mark X in diagram (approximately one ship length ahead of the zone) and hold station there using very little power. 3. Don’t move. But if the ice baffles in around you, orient the ship using thrusters slightly to the north or northwest in order to deflect the ice down along the ship. 4. Use leeway from the tanker at a distance of about a ship’s width away (20 meters). If there is still ice in between you and the tanker, stem in a little bit towards the tanker.
