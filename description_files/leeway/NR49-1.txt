1. Approach – come alongside the vessel and proceed through the zone.2. Maneuver – use pushing and prop washing as the vessel moves through the zone and alongside the tanker. As you pass through the zone, the ice in the zone next to the tanker will be cleared and then the current takes away what is not clear.3. Leeway - Station the vessel in a leeway position off bow of the tanker. The vessel should prevent other ice from entering the zone alongside the tanker. So angle the vessel at a 45 degree heading ahead of the tanker and keep the ice from slipping in between the vessels. The angle of the leeway is because you would have a lot of the current on the vessel’s port side, but using this way the ice should flow down and keep on moving away from the target area.
