1. Approach above the target zone
2. Turn the ship and go broadside
3. Put shipâ€™s starboard side facing the ice
Note to improve the approach:
1. be closer to the tanker otherwise you pin the floes between the two ships
2. You can incline your bow to more from west to southwest. Being perpendicular to the ice flow and pushing it forward cause you to run out of power.
