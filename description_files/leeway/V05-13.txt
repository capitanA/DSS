1. Approach the tanker, gradually turning away so that the support vessel is parallel with the tanker (not too close to the tanker, safe speed). Proceed through the clear away zone and past the bow of the tanker. 2. Ahead of the bow of the tanker turn to starboard and position your vessel’s bow at the centerline of the tanker. The vessel’s distance from the bow of the tanker depends on the drift.3. Use the hull of the vessel to block ice and use thrust to carry most of the ice stern and away from the tanker. Use prop wash as well.4. Try to hold the position and not set down on tanker. If the vessel is starting to move towards tanker, go further up current/drift.5. Warning: the problem with turning starboard side is that if you need to go back to the clear away zone, you will need to make a circular circle. There is less flexibility with this option if you do not have enough power.
