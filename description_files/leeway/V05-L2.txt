1. Proceed up the side of the tanker in a parallel orientation. Pass through the clear away zone. 2. Near the bow of the tanker turn your vessel to port (away from the tanker). Position your vessel at an angle (heading toward the southwest) so that your stern is facing the tanker’s bow.3. Allow the vessel to drift back to just ahead of the clear away zone.4. Hold position. Try to reduce your set and put thrust against the tanker’s hull. Ice will buildup on starboard side of your vessel and you will create a clear area down drift (the vessel could drift down to zone).5. Warning: The angle off the tanker is important; you should avoid creating a funnel between the two vessels (e.g. using heading towards northwest is not appropriate in this case).
