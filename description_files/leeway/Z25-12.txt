1. Approach the tanker by moving forward and getting on the same heading as the tanker (turn heading to be parallel with the tanker). 2. Move parallel to the tanker, as you move up alongside the tanker the ice will disperse on both sides of your vessel and it will help reduce/avoid pushing ice into the side of tanker.3. At position 3 in the diagram, move the vessel over to position 4 using the broadside of the vessel (forward momentum as well as moving starboard). Position your vessel’s bow to stem current; this creates less resistance on the vessel.4. Watch for small pieces of ice between your vessel and the tanker because if you get ice between the vessel and the tanker even at 2 feet thick, it would make contact with the tanker.5. Adjust the vessel’s heading to see how it affects the ice and position the vessel to sit that way (e.g. on an angle). Creating a Leeway at the position 4 in the diagram.
