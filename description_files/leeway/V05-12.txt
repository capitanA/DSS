1. Approach the tanker, gradually turning away so that the support vessel is parallel with the tanker. Proceed through the clear away zone and past the bow of the tanker. 2. Ahead of the bow of the tanker turn to port (helpful if you need to back to the clear away zone) and position your vessel’s stern off the bow of the tanker and hold position (the stern of the support vessel would be almost in line with the side of the tanker). The vessel’s distance from the bow of the tanker depends on the drift.3. The goal is to prevent ice from going down the tanker’s port side. To hold that position, use your port engine with rudder towed out to port, and your bow thrusters (to keep the ice from loading up on the bow). The ice will be deflected the starboard side of the tanker.4. Try to hold the position and not set down on tanker. If the vessel is starting to move towards tanker, go further up current/drift.
