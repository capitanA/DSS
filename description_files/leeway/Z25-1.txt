1. Approach the tanker by moving forward and change heading to be parallel with the tanker.
2. Move parallel to the tanker, as you move up alongside the tanker the ice will disperse on both sides of your vessel and it will help reduce/avoid pushing ice into the side of tanker.3. At #3 in the diagram, move the vessel to position 4 using the broadside of the vessel (forward momentum as well as moving starboard). Position your vessel’s bow to stem the current.
4. Watch for small pieces of ice between your vessel and the tanker because it would make contact with the tanker.5. at position 4, the closer you are to the tanker the less area the ice has to move. You should be able to move ice over to the other side of the tanker (starboard side). Then use the vessel’s thruster wash to clear this area of ice behind the vessel. See how effective the prop-wash technique is at this position and adjust your distance back to the zone.6. Once the water is clear of ice behind the vessel, move back towards the zone and use prop-wash to clear ice out of the zone.
