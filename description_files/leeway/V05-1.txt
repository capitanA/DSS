1. Position your vessel either parallel or on a slight angle to the tanker. Use thrusters or the conditions to turn the vessel to maintain the orientation (try to use the thrusters as little as possible in ice).2. Establish a distance off the tanker (parallel to the tanker) and head up the side of the tanker at slow speed and use the prop-wash at the same time. 3. Once you arrived ahead of the zone, turn the vessel towards starboard so that your vessel’s bow is towards the bow of the tanker (slight angle). Use your vessel to block the ice from moving down and use the prop-wash to flush out the ice astern of it.4. If the current is setting the vessel back, constantly move the vessel ahead and continue flushing the ice using prop-wash technique.5. Judge the vessel’s distance from the tanker to ensure that the ice does not flow between them. If so, position the vessel closer to the bow of the tanker.
