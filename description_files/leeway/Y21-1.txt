1. Approach and make a pass to the bow of the tanker and stop at the bow (going at a speed of about 2 knots). Avoid cutting too close to the tanker. You donâ€™t want to drive floes onto tanker.2. At the bow of the tanker turn starboard, pointing your bow toward tanker (heading= 45-60 degrees, distance=a little bit off the bow of the tanker).3. Maintain the position with the tunnel thrusters (maintaining the side force with the thrusters should be fine, but you could use the engines too). Use prop-wash from engines to give flow.4. Adjust your position as needed.
