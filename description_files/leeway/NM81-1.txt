1. Approach – come up through the zone alongside the vessel. Head for the southwest quadrant of the zone, while turning to port and proceeding up towards the bow of the tanker.2. Leeway at tanker bow - Once you get to the bow, hold position, basically turn to port and create a leeway. Distance above tanker for leeway would be 150 to 200 meters and minimum distance between vessel stern and tanker might be 10 meters.3. Prop-wash at tanker bow - Turn to the northwest and use the prop wash and push the ice and try to maintain position at the bow of the tanker. Hold station until required. 4. If the ice overcomes your vessel, come down the hull of the tanker towards the zone [red in diagram] and try to create a new leeway. Change the angle from heading northwest to the west or southwest and that should help keep the ice pushed up so that it comes down the hull of the vessel.
