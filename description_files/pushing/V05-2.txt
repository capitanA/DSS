1. Approach upstream of the platform
2. Create a lee and hold position (i.e. with twin-screw, when ice piles up on the side, to keep position we try to have the port rudder straight and the starboard rudder angled downward. As the ice builds-up on the hull, it begins to come down off the stern and is sent away by the port engine prop-wash).3. After spending half the time on one side of the platform, slowly extend the clearing by moving forward (from position 1 to 2 on the diagram). Use prop-wash to create eddies to flush the ice away and increase the opening.4. Distance from platform depends on the floe speed and time available5. Maybe 60-75 degrees in an optimum heading. We want the ice to come down the hull on one side.6. Depending on effectiveness of dispersing the ice on the first pass, repeat this again and go from side to side.
