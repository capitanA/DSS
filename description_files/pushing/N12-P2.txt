1. Approach (J approach - enter ice south of zone/installation).2. Set the aspect (head into ice conditions).3. Orient vessel at a distance of ‘ship’s beam’ from platform because ice floes are the size of the width of the vessel.4. Orient direction of vessel to stem current (headway, stem current with ship’s engine power).5. Move laterally with thrusters to push ice one way with broadside of vessel, then to the other way (side to side).
