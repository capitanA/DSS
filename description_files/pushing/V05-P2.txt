1. Come in ahead of the platform and turn away from the platform (rudders hard over, slow speed and high thrust)2. Start doing circles at slow speed. 3. The distance from the platform depends on the drift speed and time available.4. Keep doing circles (going from position 1, 2, 3, around in the diagram), the circles get bigger and bigger (keep speed slow for tighter turns because the speed will increase).  5. Gradually increase speed to 2-3 knots to increase the turning circles. As you start speeding up to 2-3 knots, the turning circle get larger.
