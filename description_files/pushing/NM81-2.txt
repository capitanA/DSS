1. Approach towards the northwest corner of the platform.2. Once you get to the northwest corner, turn towards north and keep your heading at northeast and maximize the lee on starboard hull. Once you get to a certain heading, move bodily sideways.3. Clear the west side of the platform first [shown in green], then move across with the goal to clear both sides with thrust wash and vessel movement (pushing). Then maintain position using thrust wash [shown in red]. 4. Use Prop-wash and Leeway. Using the propwash the port side would be clear and the leeway with bow will clear the other side of the zone.
