1. Approach (enter ice north of zone/installation)
2. Start doing circles about the north-east of the rig
3. Change the aspect (head toward west and then north and then east for completing the first circle)
4. Start doing second circle about the north-east of the rig
Note to improve the approach:
1. Be careful not to pin the ice between the rig and the ship when you are pushing the ice with your vesselâ€™s bow.
2. Instead of pushing with the bow around the platform use the broadside.
3. Instead of doing second circle just operate at above the platform because the current will clear the ice downstream.
