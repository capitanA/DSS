1. Pick shortest route up current/ahead of platform to approach. The ice is going to drift away along the sides of the platform.2. Change the vessel heading to maximize pushing technique (e.g. orient vessel to stem current, facing ice). 3. Above the platform (about 75m), push across using broadside of vessel to push. Prioritize the ice up drift over the ice already in the zone surrounding the platform because the ice around the platform will drift away with the current.4. Move back and forth (sideways) using tunnel thrusters (careful of thrusters in ice). Repeat the process in the other direction and go back to other side to push ice that is settling down. The range from side to side depends on the drift speed (e.g. the extremities of the zone to keep ice from drifting into the zone). The sweeps from side to side should not be too large and the size sweeps depend on ice drift speed to manage/avoid ice setting back down on platform.5. Repeat these maneuvers as required.
