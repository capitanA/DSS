1. Approach from further up and turn the vessel in the ice to stem the current (Stemming the current with the vessel allows the bow to move the ice apart). Heading into the current (stemming the current) has the least impact on the vessel.2. Back down on to the platform. While backing down the vessel is generating wash to clear behind the vessel and the area around the platform. By moving back, the vessel is able to decrease the pressure on the platform legs.3. As soon as the vessel stops ahead of the platform (100 meters or a ship’s length from platform), move back and forth with broadside of the vessel using tunnel thrusters to cross (at a speed of 2-3 knots) and use prop-wash from the stern propellers to clear. You can use your rudders to direct the stream of prop-wash out from the sides of the vessel (i.e. split rudders and out prop-wash out from both sides) and then move back and forth (18 meters on either side).4. The slower the vessel is moving the more effective your thrusters will be on helping maneuver the vessel. But you can’t go too slow because the vessel will start to set down with the ice.5. Prioritize clearing the ice closer to the platform.
