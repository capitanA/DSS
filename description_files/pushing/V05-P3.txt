1. Approach the installation then turn to heading into the sea/drift (stemming the current. The bow is enforced for ice so this orientation prevents the hull from exposure to damage)  2. Stop ahead of the platform (200-500m, the distance would be determined based on the power needed to maintain the vessel’s position). Hold position by increasing thrust (towing rudder outwards so the flaps are at maximum or to an angle where you can increase thrust). 3. Some prop-wash goes past the rudders and forces you to go ahead. Adjust the thrust and rudder angle to minimize that forward surge (so the vessel is not making headway) and to maximize the outward force of the thrust away from the port and starboard side of the hull. 4. Adjust the rudder angle to get the ice to move away from the sides.
