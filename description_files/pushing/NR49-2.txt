1. Approach directly to the zone/installation.2. Orient the vessel pointing the bow towards the platform at a distance of 75 to 125 meters away from platform3. Maneuver the vessel down the side of the zone broadside with thrusters to push ice out of the zone. Proceed around the back and the other side of the platform and try to do the same thing (push the ice out of the zone). Use a combination of pushing with the bow and broadside so that you avoid pushing the ice on to the platform.4. Once the zone is clear then, just maneuvering back and forth in the front of the platform.
