1. Approach above the zone (not above the platform because the current could drag you down onto the platform)
2. Start clearing the front of the zone by transiting back and forth ahead of the platform. Donâ€™t go back and forth in a forward and backwards motion, do the loop pass (back and forth using the bow).
3. keep ahead of the platform clear. The rest of the area in the box will remain clear because the current is coming down.
